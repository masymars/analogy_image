## Features

- Select and display input images: Image A, Image A', Image B.
- Set parameters like Kappa, NLevels, KCoarse, and KFine.
- Run the image analogy script with the selected images and parameters.
- Display thumbnails of selected images.
- Modern and user-friendly interface.

## Usage
  
Select Image A, Image A', and Image B by clicking the "Browse" buttons.
Enter the desired values for Kappa, NLevels, KCoarse, and KFine.
