# Image Analogies GUI

The Image Analogies GUI is a graphical user interface for running image analogy scripts using a pyramid-based approach. It allows users to select input images, set parameters, and generate image analogies easily.



## Features

- Select and display input images: Image A, Image A', Image B.
- Set parameters like Kappa, NLevels, KCoarse, and KFine.
- Run the image analogy script with the selected images and parameters.
- Display thumbnails of selected images.
- Modern and user-friendly interface.
- 
## Usage
  
Select Image A, Image A', and Image B by clicking the "Browse" buttons.
Enter the desired values for Kappa, NLevels, KCoarse, and KFine.
Click the "Run Script" button to generate the image analogy (output B').
The resulting image B' will be saved as "output.png" in the project directory.
